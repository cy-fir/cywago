Wondering what are the common terms or words associated with other words used in most industry blogs, articles or posts?

- Want to build better search patterns based on words or terms security researchers use to produce high-fidelity results?

Tough, this isn't a one-stop shop, but it can help with whatever intermediate tasks or OSINT projects you are looking to complete.

**Cybersecurity-Word-Association-a-Go!**

_A Collection of cybersecurity terms, keywords, common words often used in security research / industry reports from OSINT_

The aim of this project is to assist infosec / cyber security researchers in forming search patterns to increase the fidelity of results; ergo increasing the usefulness or utility of Cyber Threat Intelligence contexts.

Contributors seeking to add other parent groups or add more terms to parent group, may perform a pull-request and merge to existing--Thanks for supporting!

**DISCLAIMER**: This is not complete by any means, the terms and words used here are from few months worth of collection I personally found helpful when I wanted to improve my search results.  Use as is.
